  [ ] Setup alerts for critical events
  [ ] Daily performance review


NEXT STEPS
==========

1. MOCK MODE TESTING (Recommended - 3-7 days)
   Command: python run_mock_3days.py
   Purpose: Validate strategy in simulated environment
   
2. PAPER MODE TESTING (Recommended - 2 weeks)
   - Edit .env: PAPER_MODE=true
   - Command: python main.py
   - Purpose: Test with real prices but no real money
   
3. LIVE MODE (When ready)
   - Edit .env: LIVE_MODE=true, configure IOL credentials
   - Command: python main.py
   - Action: Start trading with real capital
